# Purpose

One of the task that we need to do in all our new BizTalk environment over and over again is creating BizTalk security groups and service accounts. Although this will be handled by Domain Administrator from customer's organization, BizTalk admin user is supposed to provide all the detail required prior to BizTalk installation. You could hand this script along with spreadsheet [here](http://ahkim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/25/BizTalk-Groups-and-Accounts.xlsx) and make communication between yourself and Domain administrator easier.
