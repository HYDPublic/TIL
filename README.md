# TIL

Inspired by [thoughbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til), this is a repo to share everyday learning of my own. 

Compilation of Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining concepts, bits of syntax, commands, or tips I've recently learned.

# How to TIL

When I learn something, add a Markdown file to this repo explaining it in concise terms. Place the file in a directory which best describes the content of the tip. Create a new directory if no existing one fits.

# Writing a good TIL

TIL's should be a focused and concise piece of knowledge that's interesting and worth sharing with others.

Here's some guidelines on how to write a great TIL:

Avoid writing more than 60 lines of content.
Avoid writing more than 2 examples.
Avoid going into too much detail.
Avoid writing TIL's that explicitly violate our guides.
If you find TIL straying from these guidelines consider narrowing the scope of your TIL or writing a blog post on the subject.
