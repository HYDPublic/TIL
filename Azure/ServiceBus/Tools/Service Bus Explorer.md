# Service Bus explorer

### Where to grab Service Bus Explorer

This is an open source tool project [here](https://github.com/paolosalvatori/ServiceBusExplorer) for admin but also for integration developer. 

### Cautions

#### Unsupported .vdproj

If you fail to load source code for installer project from VS2013, install the extension [here](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/9abe329c-9bba-44a1-be59-0fbf6151054d)

#### An item with the same key has already been added

When you select SASConnectionString and enters the same information as follows, it gives an error ["An item with the same key has already been added."](https://github.com/paolosalvatori/ServiceBusExplorer/issues/35)

CustomConnectionString however connects without the issue.
