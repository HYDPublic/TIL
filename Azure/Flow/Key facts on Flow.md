# Key facts on Flow

### What is it for
- Flow is good for simple integrations and empowering users to do integrations without going through devs + IT
- However, sometimes IT / devs need to take over when the Flow gets too advanced or becomes business-critical
- Any Flow can be converted to a Logic App (will be one-click later this year)

### Under the hood of Flow

- Built on top of Logic Apps
- Flow has additional UX / experiences to simplify experience for typical office worker.
